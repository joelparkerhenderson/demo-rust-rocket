# Rocket.toml
#
# An optional Rocket.toml file can be used to specify the configuration
# parameters for each environment. If it is not present, the default
# configuration parameters are used. Rocket searches for the file starting at
# the current working directory. If it is not found there, Rocket checks the
# parent directory. Rocket continues checking parent directories until the root
# is reached.
#
# The file must be a series of TOML tables, at most one for each environment,
# and an optional "global" table. Each table contains key-value pairs
# corresponding to configuration parameters for that environment. If a
# configuration parameter is missing, the default value is used. The following
# is a complete Rocket.toml file, where every standard configuration parameter
# is specified with the default value.
#
# The parameters `workers` and `secret_key` are computed by Rocket by default.
#
# If you prefer to specify `workers`, the value should be an integer, such as:
#
#     workers = 10
#
# If you prefer to specify `secret_key`, the value should a 256-bit base64
# encoded string, such as a string generated by `openssl rand -base64 32`:
#
#     secret_key = "tCbBLLFmPdzCEBXQVhbUbEewPULZZtOqi1Ro2CoDMQA="
#
# The "global" pseudo-environment can be used to set and/or override
# configuration parameters globally. A parameter defined in a [global] table
# sets, or overrides if already present, that parameter in every environment.
# For example, given the following Rocket.toml file, the value of address will
# be "1.2.3.4" in every environment:
#
#     [global]
#     address = "1.2.3.4"
#
# If you use Transport Layer Security (TLS) then you can configure it here,
# or by using environment variables, or in a programmatic ConfigBuilder.
#
#     [development]
#     tls = { certs = "/path/to/certs.pem", key = "/path/to/key.pem" }

[global]
template_dir = "www/templates/"

# Database example using Diesel and PostgreSQL.
# The Rocket URL below must match the Diesel URL as set in the file `.env`.
